AVL are height blanced binary trees.
Height of the tree is manged by blance factor

blance_factor: height_of_left_sub_tree - height_of_right_sub_tree

bf = hl - hr
This blance factor we calculate on every node of AVL tree.

The Blance factor of every node must be  {-1, 0, 1}
if bf = |hl - hr| <= 1 then it is blance

if bf = |hl - hr| > 1 then it is imblance

Every node in the tree should be blanced other wise it is called imblanced avl tree.

We perfome rotation to blance the tree.
